# Welcome to the Gluu Cluster Documentation

The Gluu Cluster is a high availabiliy and high reliability solution for enterprise authoriztion and authentication.
The advantages of the cluster system includes elasticity, scalability, security, and a simple management procedure.
The procedure is made simple through the cluster management system, Gluu Flask.
The Gluu Server Cluster is divided into two packages identified "master" and "consumer". The "master" package is offered free and the "consumer" package requires a commercial license.

`Note`: currently the Cluster Edition only supports oxAuth, oxTrust and LDAP. Support for Shibboleth IDP version 3
is planed for release 0.4 of the Gluu Clusters packages.
