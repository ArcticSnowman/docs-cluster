# Gluu Cluster Documentation

Documentation for the new docker-based Gluu Server cluster recipe is currently under development. Please continue to check back here for updates. We are expecting complete documentation by the end of June, 2015. 

In the meantime, you can deploy a single instance of the Gluu Server on [CentOS](http://www.gluu.org/docs/admin-guide/deployment/centos/) or [Ubuntu](http://www.gluu.org/docs/admin-guide/deployment/ubuntu/) using chroot. 

Thank you for your interest!
